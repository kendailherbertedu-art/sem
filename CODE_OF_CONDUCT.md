# Group 10 DevOps - Team Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

As members of Group 10, we're committed to creating a respectful, collaborative, and productive environment where everyone can contribute their best work. We recognize that university projects are learning experiences, and we pledge to support each other throughout this journey.

---

## Our Core Values

### 1. Respect and Inclusion
- We value every team member's input, regardless of their technical skill level or background
- We listen when others are speaking and give everyone a chance to contribute
- We recognize that people have different learning styles, schedules, and responsibilities outside this project
- We communicate respectfully in all channels - meetings, WhatsApp/Discord, email, code reviews, and commit messages

### 2. Honest Communication
- We're upfront about our capabilities and honest when we don't understand something
- We ask for help when we need it and offer help when we can give it
- We give realistic estimates about when we can complete tasks
- We let the team know as soon as possible if we're running behind or facing difficulties
- We respond to team messages within 24 hours (or let people know if we'll be unavailable)

### 3. Shared Responsibility
- We all take ownership of the project's success - not just our individual tasks
- We review each other's code constructively and respectfully
- We help teammates who are struggling rather than leaving them behind
- We document our work so others can understand and build on it
- We commit to pulling the latest changes regularly and resolving merge conflicts promptly

### 4. Professional Conduct
- We only work on code we understand or are actively learning
- We admit when we've made a mistake and work to fix it
- We don't commit broken code to master/develop without testing
- We write clear commit messages that explain what we changed and why
- We keep our work properly organized in feature branches

### 5. Continuous Learning
- We see challenges as opportunities to grow, not reasons to give up
- We share knowledge with teammates when we learn something new
- We're patient when explaining concepts to others
- We welcome feedback on our work and use it to improve
- We stay updated with the project requirements and attend team meetings

## What We Don't Do

### Unacceptable Behavior Includes:
- **Disrespectful communication**: Insulting, belittling, or dismissive language toward team members
- **Ghosting**: Disappearing without communicating or ignoring team messages for extended periods
- **Free-riding**: Consistently not pulling your weight or letting others do your work
- **Sabotage**: Deliberately breaking the build, deleting others' work, or force-pushing without agreement
- **Taking credit**: Claiming work done by others as your own
- **Exclusion**: Making decisions or significant changes without consulting the team
- **Unfair workload**: Consistently dumping tasks on others or refusing to help when available
- **Last-minute disasters**: Waiting until the deadline to say you haven't done your part

## Our Working Agreements

### Communication
- We'll use [Discord/WhatsApp/other] as our primary communication channel
- We'll have weekly team meetings on [day/time]
- We'll update the team on our progress at least twice a week
- We'll respond to urgent messages within a few hours when possible

### Git and Version Control
- We won't push directly to master/develop - we'll use feature branches
- We'll pull the latest changes before starting work each day
- We'll write meaningful commit messages
- We'll test our code locally before pushing
- We'll ask for code reviews on significant changes

### Meetings and Deadlines
- We'll arrive on time (or give advance notice if we can't)
- We'll come prepared and have completed our assigned tasks
- We'll set realistic deadlines as a team
- We'll give at least 48 hours notice if we can't meet a deadline

### Problem-Solving
- If we're stuck for more than 2 hours, we'll ask for help
- If we have a disagreement, we'll discuss it respectfully as a team
- If someone's not meeting expectations, we'll address it directly but kindly
- If issues can't be resolved within the team, we'll involve our module coordinator

## Resolving Issues

### If You're Struggling:
1. Tell the team as early as possible
2. Explain what you're stuck on specifically
3. Let us know what help you need
4. We'll work together to find a solution

### If Someone Else is Struggling:
1. Reach out to them privately first with genuine concern
2. Offer specific help or resources
3. If the issue continues, bring it up with the full team
4. As a last resort, escalate to the module coordinator

### If There's a Conflict:
1. Address it directly but respectfully with the person involved
2. Focus on the behavior or issue, not the person
3. If you can't resolve it, involve the full team
4. Remember we're all learning and mistakes happen

---

## Our Commitment to Each Other

By being part of Group 10, we each commit to:
- **Show up**: Be present, engaged, and responsive
- **Speak up**: Share our ideas, concerns, and questions
- **Help out**: Support our teammates when they need it
- **Own up**: Take responsibility for our work and our mistakes
- **Grow together**: Learn from this experience and help each other succeed

---

## Consequences

If a team member consistently violates this Code of Conduct:
1. First instance: Private conversation with the team member
2. Second instance: Team meeting to discuss the issue and create an improvement plan
3. Continued issues: Involvement of module coordinator and potential adjustment of individual contributions in peer assessment

We hope it never comes to this because we're all here to learn and succeed together.
